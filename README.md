On this page, I implemented the HTML and CSS knowledge gained from the courses: Udemy, Prometheus, EPAM. Such knowledge as box model, cascading, combining CSS selectors, CSS positioning, flex-box, and more. I am also acquainted with floating, but I want this page to be responsive, so I didn't show it in this work. Also, this page is designed to show you my skills with CSS, and some of the links were just hashed, but in the future, I will make them work.
